<ol> 

 
    
### <li>Download the dataset from the link given in this repo.</li>
    
  ###    <li>I have stored the dataset in a folder called css-data, you can change the name and give its location as a INPUT_DIR.</li>

###   <li>The path of train ,val , testn number of classes and class names is stored in a dictionary variable and dumped in data.yaml.</li>
<ul>
  
#### <li>yaml : It is a human-readable data serialization format. It is often used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures.</li>
</ul>

###   <li>I have plotted the frequency of each class in train, val and test using seaborn library.</li>

###   <li>Loaded the pretrained YOLO-nano model. After training the model, I have saved the model as best.pt</li>

###   <li>The same model is again tested using test data set.</li>
